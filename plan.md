# Budget App Implementation Plan

## 1. State Management (Zustand)
- Implementation Strategy:
  - Create centralized store for:
    - User data and authentication state
    - Budget categories and transactions
    - App settings and preferences
  - Use zustand-persist for offline data persistence
  - Implement separate stores for different domains (auth, transactions, settings)

## 2. Database Architecture (Hybrid Approach)
- Local Storage (SQLite):
  - Store immediate transactions
  - Cache frequently accessed data
  - Maintain offline capabilities
  - Schema:
    - Transactions
    - Categories
    - Budgets
    - User preferences

- Cloud Storage (PostgreSQL):
  - Master data store
  - Cross-device synchronization
  - Backup and recovery
  - Analytics and reporting
  
- Sync Strategy:
  - Queue-based synchronization
  - Conflict resolution
  - Timestamp-based versioning
  - Background sync with retry mechanism

## 3. Authentication System
- Implementation:
  - JWT + Session based authentication
  - Biometric authentication for mobile
  - OAuth 2.0 social login options

- Security Features:
  - Token refresh mechanism
  - Session management
  - Device registration
  - Multi-factor authentication

## 4. Security Measures
- Data Protection:
  - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
  - AES-256 encryption for stored data
  - Secure key storage
  - Data masking for sensitive information

- API Security:
  - Rate limiting
  - CORS configuration
  - Input validation
  - XSS protection
  - CSRF protection

- Compliance:
  - GDPR compliance
  - CCPA compliance
  - Data retention policies
  - Privacy policy implementation

## 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit Testing (Jest):
  - Business logic
  - Components
  - State management
  - Utils and helpers

- E2E Testing:
  - Cypress for web
  - Detox for mobile
  - Test scenarios:
    - User flows
    - Authentication
    - Data synchronization
    - Offline functionality

- Integration Testing:
  - API endpoints
  - Database operations
  - Third-party integrations
