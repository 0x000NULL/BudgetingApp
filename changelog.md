## TypeScript Script Infrastructure Enhancement - 2024-03-14 15:00 UTC (v1.0.3)

### Added Node.js Script Infrastructure
#### New TypeScript Scripts
- Created `scripts/clean.ts` for enhanced project cleanup
  - Improved cleaning process with Promise-based operations
  - Added comprehensive directory cleaning across monorepo
  - Implemented safe recursive deletion with error handling
  - Added support for cleaning build artifacts and dependencies

- Created `scripts/verify-env.ts` for environment validation
  - Added automatic environment variable verification
  - Implemented `.env.example` based validation
  - Added detailed error reporting for missing variables
  - Integrated pre-run checks for dev and build commands

- Created `scripts/setup.ts` for project initialization
  - Added automated project setup process
  - Implemented dependency installation
  - Added default environment file creation
  - Integrated Prisma database initialization
  - Added comprehensive error handling

### Package.json Improvements
#### Script Updates
- Replaced basic clean command with TypeScript implementation
- Added new npm scripts:
  - `setup`: Project initialization script
  - `verify-env`: Environment validation
  - `predev` and `prebuild`: Automatic environment checks
- Updated version to 1.0.2 to reflect infrastructure improvements

### Technical Improvements
- **Reliability**: More robust cleaning process
- **Safety**: Added environment validation
- **DX**: Improved project setup experience
- **Maintainability**: TypeScript-based script infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Automation**: Streamlined development workflow

### Breaking Changes
- Changed clean script implementation
- Added mandatory environment validation before dev/build
- Requires TypeScript for script execution

### Notes
- Scripts require `ts-node` for execution
- Environment validation requires `.env.example` file
- Clean script now handles monorepo structure
- Setup script includes database initialization

### Future Considerations
- Add database backup/restore scripts
- Implement deployment scripts
- Add migration automation
- Add test coverage scripts
- Add documentation generation scripts 

# API Error Handling and Validation Enhancement - 2024-03-07 16:00 UTC (v1.0.2)

### Error System Implementation
#### Core Error Handling
- Implemented `AppError` class for standardized error handling
  - Provides consistent error structure across the application
  - Enables better error tracking and debugging
  - Allows for detailed error information with type safety
- Added `ErrorCode` enum for standardized error classification
  - Ensures consistent error categorization
  - Improves error handling predictability
  - Enables better error filtering and reporting

### Router Improvements
#### Transaction Router
- Added category existence validation before transaction creation
  - Prevents orphaned transactions
  - Ensures data integrity
  - Improves user feedback
- Enhanced error messages for better debugging and user experience
- Added type-safe error responses for better frontend integration

#### Category Router
- Implemented cascade delete protection
  - Prevents deletion of categories with existing transactions
  - Maintains referential integrity
  - Improves data consistency
- Added ownership validation for all operations
  - Enhances security
  - Prevents unauthorized access
  - Maintains data isolation between users

#### Budget Router
- Added comprehensive date validation
  - Ensures start date is before end date
  - Improves data validity
  - Prevents logical errors in budget planning
- Implemented category existence checks
  - Maintains data integrity
  - Prevents invalid budget assignments
  - Improves user experience

### Technical Enhancements
- **Error Handling**:
  - Standardized error patterns across all routers
  - Improved error message clarity
  - Added detailed error context for debugging
- **Type Safety**:
  - Enhanced type exports for better frontend integration
  - Added proper error type definitions
  - Improved TypeScript integration
- **Validation**:
  - Added comprehensive input validation
  - Implemented ownership checks
  - Enhanced data integrity checks

### Breaking Changes
- Modified error response structure to use `AppError`
- Changed error handling patterns across all routers
- Updated error import paths for better organization
- Added stricter validation requirements

### Migration Guide
1. Update error handling to use new `AppError` class
2. Implement new validation requirements in API calls
3. Update error handling in frontend components
4. Adjust error import paths

### Future Considerations
- Implement error tracking service integration
- Add error analytics and monitoring
- Enhance error documentation
- Add automated error reporting
- Implement error recovery strategies

# 2024-03-07 15:00 - v1.0.0
## Project Structure and Component Library Setup

### Added
- Created base project structure with monorepo setup using Turborepo
- Implemented shared UI component library (@budget/ui)
  - Added theme system with colors, typography, spacing, and breakpoints
  - Created base components (Button, Input, Card, Text, Stack)
  - Added responsive hooks (useMediaQuery, usePlatform, useTheme)
  - Implemented platform-specific utilities for web/mobile compatibility

### Added Infrastructure
- Set up tRPC API structure (@budget/api)
  - Added router configuration with type-safe procedures
  - Created base router structure for auth, transactions, categories, and budgets
- Configured TypeScript presets (@budget/config)
  - Added shared TypeScript configuration for consistent setup across packages
  - Implemented path aliases for better import management

### Technical Details
- Theme system uses Emotion for CSS-in-JS styling
- Components are built to be platform-agnostic, working on both web and mobile
- API uses tRPC for end-to-end type safety
- Configured workspace dependencies for optimal package management

### Reasoning
- Monorepo structure allows for better code sharing and maintenance
- Shared UI library ensures consistent design across platforms
- tRPC provides type safety between frontend and backend
- Platform-agnostic components reduce code duplication
